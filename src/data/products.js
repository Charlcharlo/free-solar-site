By leveraging this functionality, a wireless network extension of your home network can be broadcast anywhere within the range of the equipment. It’s almost as powerful and useful as having an ISP in your own backyard where WIFI coverage is needed but unavailable.\n\nThese towers feature a professional-standard 23 dBi directional antenna for long-range wireless transmission. With a 23 dBi high-gain directional Cassegrain antenna and dedicated metal reflector, the CPE710 provides excellent beam directivity, improved latency, and noise immunity. Professional performance coupled with user-friendly design makes the 5 GHz 867 Mbps 23 dBi Outdoor CPE710 an ideal choice and cost-effective solution for outdoor long-distance wireless networking applications.",
