Articles:

1. Place the article's image into the articles folder inside the images 
folder (NOT THE IMAGES FOLDER IN BUILD)
2. copy the following template and paste into articles.js:

{
    title: "", //Title of the Article
    image: '', //Full filename of image in public/images/articles (eg: image.png)
    sections: [
        //Copy and paste the following four lines for each subheading of the article
        {
            title: "",
            body: ``
        },
    ]
},

If you would like to add an image to a paragraph, paste the following 
within the curly bracers:

    hasImage: true, 
    image: "", //the filename
    imageTag: "", //Optional description of the image

3. In the command line cd to your folder
4. To preview the article, type npm start
5. To compile a build folder for deployment, hit npm run build
6. Copy the contents of the build folder to the server. 
7. Make sure you don't delete .htaccess as this is necessary for the routing of the page
